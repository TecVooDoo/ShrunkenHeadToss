# Shrunken Head Toss - Game Design Document

**Version:** 5
**Date:** December 19, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025
**Developer:** TecVooDoo LLC
**Designer:** Rune (Stephen Brandon)
**Platform:** Unity 6.3 (2D)
**Target:** PC/Mobile/Console
**Inspiration:** Cornhole meets Beetlejuice

---

## High Concept

A casual PvP skill game where players toss shrunken heads onto a bed of spikes, competing for accuracy and style. Two players face off in head-to-head (literally) competition, flinging tiny craniums across a backyard arena.

**Key Innovation:** Upload photos of yourself, friends, or family to create personalized shrunken head game pieces. Fun for the whole family!

**Aesthetic:** Norman Rockwell meets 80s gore flick - warm, nostalgic Americana settings with gratuitous splatter and dark humor.

## Core Gameplay

### The Toss

**Input:**
- **Desktop:** Click and drag to set angle/power, release to throw
- **Mobile:** Touch and drag, release to throw
- **Controller:** Analog stick for angle, button hold for power

**Physics:**
- Arc trajectory based on angle and power
- Optional: wind affecting flight path
- Head rotation during flight (visual flair)

### The Target: Spike Bed

```
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|    /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\       |
|   /  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \      |
|  /    \  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /    \     |
| /      \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/      \    |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Spike Zones:**
- Center spikes (tallest) = highest points
- Outer spikes (shorter) = lower points
- Edges = minimal points or miss

**Landing Results:**
- **Impaled:** Head sticks on spike - points awarded based on zone
- **Bounce:** Head hits and bounces - reduced points if lands in valid zone
- **Slide:** Head slides off - no points
- **Miss:** Head misses spike bed entirely - no points

### Scoring System

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Center spike impale | 10 |
| Inner ring impale | 7 |
| Outer ring impale | 5 |
| Edge impale | 3 |
| Bounce + stick | Half zone value |
| Land on another head | Bonus +3 |
| Perfect arc (style) | Bonus +1 |
| Miss | 0 |

### Round Structure

- Each player gets 4 heads per round
- Players alternate throws
- All 8 heads thrown = round complete
- Higher score wins the round
- Match is best of 3 (or 5 for longer games)

```

- Players face each other across the spike pit
- Camera shows side view of arena

## Custom Head System

### Photo Upload Feature

**Flow:**
1. Player taps "Create Head" in Head Gallery
2. Camera opens OR photo picker
3. Player takes/selects photo
4. Face detection finds the face
5. Image warped to shrunken head template
6. Player can adjust (shrink, distort, add stitches)
7. Head saved to gallery

**Shrunken Head Transform:**
- Shrink proportions (big head, tiny body remnant)
- Darken/leatherize skin tone
- Add stitched eyes/mouth options
- Exaggerated expressions

**Privacy/Safety:**
- Photos stored locally only (no server upload)
- Clear "delete" option for any custom head
- Default heads always available

### Default Head Collection

- **Classic:** Generic tribal shrunken head
- **Grumpy:** Perpetually annoyed expression
- **Cheerful:** Disturbingly happy
- **Screamer:** Frozen mid-scream
- **Sleepy:** Eyes stitched shut
- Unlockable heads via achievements

## Visual Style

### Beetlejuice Meets Rockwell

**Environments:**
- Backyard BBQ (picket fence, tree, lawn)
- County Fair (carnival booth, string lights)
- Church Picnic (folding tables, checkered cloth)
- Halloween variant (nighttime, jack-o-lanterns)

**Color Palette:**
- Warm, nostalgic base (creams, soft greens, wood browns)
- Pops of visceral red on impacts
- Slightly desaturated for vintage feel

**Characters:**
- Simple silhouette players (focus on heads)
- Friendly but slightly off expressions
- 1950s Americana clothing

### Gore Level

- Stylized, not realistic
- Cartoonish blood splatter on impacts
- Exaggerated "squish" effects
- Dark humor, not horror
- Option to reduce/disable gore for younger players

- Slow-mo on final throw of round

### Platform Specifics

| Platform | Input | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| PC | Mouse drag | Keyboard shortcuts |
| Mobile | Touch drag | Haptic feedback on impact |
| Console | Analog + button | Rumble on impact |
